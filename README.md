# Holy-Rizz-game
Introducing you the sister of flappy bird but more gen-Z styled (its my first project on unity)
All the elements and sounds are from Google. 
The element (rizzy) jumps as the space bar is pressed, and is supposed to be saved from hitting the pipes, and also from flying too high or falling down. 
The control keys are only space bar and esc key. 
The esc key prompts the pause screen, which provides options to 1. resume, 2. exit. 
The score updates as you successfully move through the pipe without hitting it. 
The code deals with its movement, the interaction of the pipe and the rizzy, and has a set width of the screen, if rizzy moves out of that specified width, the game ends. 
The code also deals with the sound effects, for example every spacebar has a sound attached to it when it is pressed, and when the game over message prompts, a different sound is heard. 
That's all ^-^
